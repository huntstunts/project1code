# Project 1

## About

This is the first group project I worked on while in my FinTech Bootcamp. It involves a dataset of all the earthquakes that have happened and sees if it's possible to predict when an earthquake will happen.

As a result, the map of all the earthquakes matched exactly with the outline of the tectonic plates, leading to evidence that earthquakes are a result of tectonic plates splitting.

The code for how I got to this conclusion can be found in the "Grouping_and_Plotting_Decades.ipynb" file.
